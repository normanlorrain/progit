# Note
This repo is public, but more of a personal project for fun, for testing PDF generation directly from markup.

The excellent [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) project has in its documentation [instructions for creating a sample epub](https://pandoc.org/epub.html).

The figures were modified according to those instructions, no need to repeat here.

Here we're testing
- pandoc (especially with new **Typst** support)
- rst2pdf
- rinohtype
- epub

## TODO:
 - RST format generated has directives for figures, which have an option block occasionally spanning more than one line. This is a problem somehow, don't know how to fix it.
