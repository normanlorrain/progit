# Note to self
This repo is public, but more of a personal project for fun.

This branch is something of a sandbox for testing various PDF creation tools
- pandoc (especially with new **Typst** support)
- rst2pdf
- rinohtype



# Progit contents (original readme)
This is the source for the 1st edition of the Pro Git book. The second edition has since been released and is what will be maintained and published going forward. Please suggest any changes to that version instead. 

You can find the new edition at:

If you're looking for the original README content, it can be found in the [README.original.md](README.original.md) file.
